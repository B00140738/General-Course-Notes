This is the introduction page for the "Object Orientation with Design Patterns", or OODP, module. This module aims to explain all 23 [[Design Patterns]] and provide examples of how each are used to solve real world problems or provide an elegant alternative to solutions offered at the moment.

This module aims to examine the following:

### [[Abstract Factory]]

This provides **an interface for creating families of related, or dependant, objects without specifying their concrete classes**. One such example is the use of a "mouseFactory" used during PHP-based Web Development with tools such as Symfony. 

In this, **the "mouseFactory" object/class extends its parent, the original abstract Factory class**. Through this **objects can be easily and dynamically instantiated**.

### [[Adapter]]

This converts the interface of a class **into another interface clients expect**. The Adapter Design pattern **allows classes that, otherwise couldn't work together due to incompatible interfaces, to work together/communicate with each other**.

### [[Bridge]]

This **decouples an abstraction from its implementation** so that the two **can vary independently**.

### [[Builder]]

This Design Pattern **separates the construction of a complex object from its representation** so that the same construction process **can create different representations**.

### [[Chain of Responsibility]]
