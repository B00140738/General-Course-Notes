The "Abstract Factory" Design Pattern allows us to **easily create families of related, or dependent, objects without specifying their concrete classes**. It does so through the use of [[Inheritance]], [[Polymorphism]] and [[Method Overriding]].

In simpler terms, **the Abstract Factory pattern helps in creating objects that belong to a common family and ensures that these objects are compatible with each other**. It promotes flexibility and extensibility by **allowing the client code to work with abstract interfaces instead of specific classes**, enabling easy substitution of entire families of objects without altering the client code.

		public abstract class AbstractFactory {
			//Abstract method (Overriden later through Polymorphism)
			abstract Shape getShape(String shapeType);
		}
		
		public class ShapeFactory extends AbstractFactory {
			@override
			public Shape getShape(String shapeType){
				if (shapeType.equals("RECTANGLE")){
					return new Rectangle(); //Return Rectangle
				}
				else if (shapeType.equals("SQUARE")){
					return new Square(); //Return Square
				}
				return null;
			}
		}

The key components of the Abstract Factory pattern include:

1. **Abstract Factory Interface**: Declares the interface for creating a family of related objects. This typically involves a set of abstract methods, each responsible for creating a specific type of object.
    
2. **Concrete Factories**: Implement the Abstract Factory interface to produce families of related concrete objects. Each concrete factory is responsible for creating a specific set of products. One example is the "mouseFactory" used in PHP Web Development using Symfony.
    
3. **Abstract Product Interface**: Declares the interface for a type of product object.
    
4. **Concrete Products**: Implement the Abstract Product interface to define specific types of products that belong to a family. Each concrete product corresponds to a specific variant within a family.
    

T**he Abstract Factory pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where the system needs to be independent of how its objects are created**, composed, and represented, and the system is configured with multiple families of objects.
