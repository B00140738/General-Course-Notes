### **What are Regular Expressions?**

Regular expressions, often abbreviated as "RegEx," are a powerful tool used in **searching, matching, and manipulating text**. They are essentially a **language or notation** designed to define patterns for identifying sequences of characters (such as letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces) in text.

### **Ways to View Regular Expressions:**

- **A language for specifying text search strings**: Regular expressions allow you to describe patterns you want to find in a body of text. For example, you can use RegEx to find all instances of phone numbers, email addresses, or specific words in a document.
    
- **A useful way to specify textual search strings**: This reinforces the idea that regular expressions help describe and locate text patterns in an efficient and concise manner.
    
- **A way to specify the design of a particular kind of machine**: This refers to the formal concept in computer science where regular expressions can be linked to a theoretical model called **finite automata**. In essence, a regular expression can be thought of as instructions for designing a machine that reads characters one by one and determines if they match the specified pattern.
    

**Equivalence**: These descriptions are equivalent because, fundamentally, regular expressions can be used to describe search patterns, whether you are thinking in terms of text searching or designing machines (finite automata) that can recognize these patterns.

### **Formal Definition:**

- **A Regular Expression (RE)** is a type of **algebraic notation** used to describe a set of strings. In simpler terms, a regular expression provides a formula or pattern that can represent multiple possible strings of characters.
    
- **A string** is any sequence of characters, which can include letters, numbers, punctuation marks, spaces, or even special characters like tabs. RegEx can be used to search or manipulate these sequences according to specific rules.
    

In summary, regular expressions are a formal way of defining patterns for matching and searching text. They can be applied in programming, data processing, and even theoretical computer science.
