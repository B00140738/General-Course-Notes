To solve the problem of finding the single number in an array where every other number appears twice, you can use the XOR bitwise operator. XOR has a useful property: `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`. This means that _if you XOR all numbers together, the numbers that appear twice will cancel out, leaving only the number that appears once_.

### Code Example

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
        int result = 0;
        for (int n : nums)
        {
            result ^= n;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```


### Code Explanation:

1. **Function Definition:**
    - `singleNumber(const std::vector<int>& nums)`:
        - This function takes a vector of integers as input and returns the single number.
    - Inside the function, we initialize `result` to 0. We then iterate through each number in the vector and apply the XOR operation (`result ^= num`).
    - By the end of the loop, `result` will contain the single number.
    
1. **Main Function:**
    - Creates three example vectors `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3`.
    - Calls `singleNumber` with these vectors and prints the results.

This code achieves the desired linear runtime complexity O(n)O(n)O(n) and uses only constant extra space O(1)O(1)O(1), adhering to the problem constraints.
