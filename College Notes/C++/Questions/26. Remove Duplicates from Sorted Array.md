## Problem Description

The problem presents an integer array called `nums` that is sorted in non-decreasing order. The goal is to remove duplicates from `nums` in a way that each unique element appears only once while maintaining the relative order of elements. This task must be done in-place, which means that we should not allocate extra space for another array, and we have to modify the original array instead.

Once duplicates are removed, we are required to return the new length of the array, which represents the number of unique elements. The first part of the array up to this new length should contain all unique elements in their original order, and whatever follows after doesn't matter.

To adhere to the problem's constraints, the final arrangement of the array and the value of `k` are checked against the expected result using the provided custom judge implementation. In simple terms, after calling the solution function, the array `nums` should have its first `k` elements without duplicates and `k` should equal the expected number of unique elements.

## Intuition

To arrive at the solution, we realize that since the array is already sorted, duplicates will be adjacent to each other. Hence, we can simply iterate through the array and compare each element with the previous one (except for the first element) to identify duplicates.

Our intuition should tell us that we need [two pointers](https://algo.monster/problems/two_pointers_intro) here: one for iterating over the array (`x` in this case) and another to keep track of the location in `nums` where the next unique element should be placed (`k`).

Starting with `k` at 0, we move through the array with `x` and when `x` is not equal to `nums[k - 1]` (which would mean `x` is not a duplicate), we place `x` at `nums[k]` and increment `k`. This works because when `x` is a duplicate of `nums[k - 1]`, we simply skip it by not incrementing `k`, hence overwriting the duplicates in subsequent steps.

The process continues to the end of the array, ensuring that all unique elements are moved to the front of the array, and `k` represents the number of unique elements. By the end of the iteration, we return `k` as the result.

## Solution Approach

The solution to this problem uses a technique commonly known as the two-pointer approach. This approach is often applied in array manipulation problems, especially when we need to modify the array in-place to satisfy certain constraints.

Here's how the two-pointer technique is applied step by step:

### Step 1: Initialize Pointer `k`

A pointer `k` is initialized to 0. This pointer is used to track the position where the next unique element should be placed in the array.

### Step 2: Iterate Through the Array

We iterate over each element `x` in the array `nums`. During iteration, `k` is used as a slow-runner pointer, while the loop index (implicitly represented by the iteration over `x`) acts as a fast-runner pointer.

### Step 3: Identify Unique Elements

We only want to act when we come across a unique element. A unique element in this sorted array is identified by checking if it is different than the element at the position just before the current `k`. This is represented by the condition `x != nums[k - 1]`.

### Step 4: Place Unique Elements and Increment Pointer `k`

When a unique element is found, we copy it to `nums[k]` and then increment `k`. This effectively shifts the unique elements to the front of the array and steps over any duplicates.

The first element is a special case because there is no `nums[k - 1]` when `k` is 0, so it's always considered unique, and we start `k` at 0 by default.

### Step 5: Handle Duplicates

When a duplicate element (which is not unique) is encountered, the body of the `if` condition does not execute, which means that `k` is not incremented. This implies that the duplicate value will be overwritten in the next iteration when a new unique element is encountered.

### Step 6: Return the Count of Unique Elements

After the iteration is completed, `k` holds the total count of unique elements, as it was incremented only when encountering a unique element. We return `k` at the end.

Here is how the implementation looks in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        k = 0
        for x in nums:
            if k == 0 or x != nums[k - 1]:
                nums[k] = x
                k += 1
        return k
```

In this code, the `if k == 0` check allows us to handle the first element correctly, and the subsequent `x != nums[k - 1]` checks help in identifying if the current element is different from the element that was last identified as unique.


### Code Examples:

##### C++:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
        int n=nums.size();
        int res=1;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();++i)
        {
            if(nums[i]!=nums[res-1])
            {
                nums[res]=nums[i];
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```


##### Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        k = 0 # slow runner
        for x in nums: # fast runner
            if k == 0 or x != nums[k-1]:  # check element before k to see if it is unique
                nums[k] = x # if so, copy it to nums[k]
                k += 1 # move to next position
        return k
```
