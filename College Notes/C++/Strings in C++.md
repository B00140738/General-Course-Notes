## Introduction

In both C++ and all other major programming languages, strings represent an array of characters that are combined together to form one, coherent, word. Similar to data types you may have worked with in the past, such as Arrays, Vectors and HashMap's (known as [[Unordered Maps]] in C++,) Strings can also be both traversed and manipulated through a variety of different means. 

This page contains both examples of, and links to various different functions belonging to the C++ standard library that can be used to get different results when working with strings in C++.  Each heading provides a link to a respective page that contains both a detailed explanation of each function along with a step-by-step example. Keep in mind that the text located underneath each heading only provides a brief overview.

## find()

The [[find()]] function is used to **find/return the first occurrence of a specified string, prefix, substring or character in a string.** This can be used to find a certain combination of letters/pattern that is present in multiple words/an Array of strings/chars.
