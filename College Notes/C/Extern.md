The `extern` keyword _extends the functionâ€™s/variables visibility to the whole program_, the function _can be used (called) anywhere in any of the files of the whole program, provided those files contain a declaration of the function._ (With the declaration of the function in place, the compiler knows the definition of the function exists somewhere else and it goes ahead and compiles the file).
