### What is Computer Vision?

Essentially, Computer Vision is **a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which allows computers to derive/obtain information from images, videos, and other sources.** It aims to help computers understand digital information presented to them. By doing this, it allows for the **extraction of [[High-Dimensional Data]] from the real world in order to produce numerical (for example, data set) or symbolic information (decisions).**
