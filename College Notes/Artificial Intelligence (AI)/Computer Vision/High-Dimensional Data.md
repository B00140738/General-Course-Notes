Simply put, High-Dimensional Data refers to **data that has many features or variables**. Let's list a primary example; *a dataset with 100 features*. This example would be considered "High-Dimensional" because **human brains have difficulty visualising data in more than three dimensions**. As a result of this, **it can be challenging to understand and analyse high dimensional data**.

High-Dimensional Data is used widely in many areas relating to [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) to train computer models to either break down or categorise data.
