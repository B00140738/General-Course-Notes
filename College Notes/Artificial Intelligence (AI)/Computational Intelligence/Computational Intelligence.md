##### Abstract: 

*Computational Intelligence allows for Artificial Intelligence to mimic human behavior in order to efficiently solve complex, ambiguous tasks.*

# What is Computational Intelligence

**Computational Intelligence** is a **set of human-inspired methodologies and approaches that can be used to solve complicated real-world problems.** This is useful when traditional approaches **are ineffective or not feasible.**


## Background:

- **Many real world problems may not translate well mathematically**, but nature provides examples of "biological systems" (humans, animals, etc.) showcasing the required functionality.

- The major flaw in previous traditional models was that **they failed to handle uncertainty, noise and changing contexts.** Computational Intelligence provides solutions through methods like Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, etc.

- CI (Computational Intelligence) also uses algorithms inspired by biology such as swarm intelligence and artificial immune systems
