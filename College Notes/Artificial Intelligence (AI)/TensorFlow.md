TensorFlow is a **python-based Module/Library used for the creation of [[Artificial Intelligence]] based programs**.

### What is a Tensor?

**Tensors are Multi-Dimensional Arrays, or Matrices**. These are useful for sorting through and analysing the values for each pixel contained in an image. Remember: **Matrices are used in the creation of images, whether it be cropping, rotating, or upscaling images**.

> [!NOTE]
> An Array is just **an ordered arrangement of numbers**. The term "Element" refers to
> **any numbers/values inside the Array**.


### Types of Tensors:

1. **0-D Tensors**: 0-D Tensors, or Zero-Dimensional Tensors/arrays are **Tensors that only contain a single element**.

2. **1-D Tensors**: 1-D Tensors, or One-Dimensional Tensors, refer to "traditional Arrays". **These, like regular arrays, contain an ordered arrangement of numbers**. A 1-D Tensor is a **combination of several 0-D Tensors (single elements)**.

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &2 &0 \\
\end{array}\right]
$$

3. **2-D Tensors**: 2-D Tensors, or Two-Dimensional Tensors, refers to a **collection of several 1-D Tensors**. One such example is:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &2 &0 \\
3 &5 &-1 \\
1 &5 &6 \\
2 &3 &8
\end{array}\right]
$$
