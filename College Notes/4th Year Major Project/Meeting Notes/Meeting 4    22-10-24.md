## Goals This Week

- **identify research methodology** (THIS WILL BE ASKED DURING DEMO)
- explain how i collect/obtain data
- identify data sets
- mention research more, RESEARCH INFLUENCES DEVELOPMENT
- don't put cart before the horse (DID TECHNOLOGY BEFORE RESEARCH)
- Explain how you collected or obtained the data, how you processed it, and what analysis methods you usedÂ - **Kaggle**: Kaggle has a wide range of datasets related to student performance and education (e.g., Student Performance Data).
- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: Contains datasets such as "Student Performance" or "Online Education Data."
- **PISA Dataset**: This is an international dataset on student performance from the OECD, which assesses students in math, science, and reading, often used for educational research.
- redo Gantt chart
- try put heading of data sets used, how i cleansed it, put chart, etc.

## Progress Update Last Week

### Key Activities

-  Updated and merged research questions into one single, detailed question: **"What impact does gamification have on academic performance and dropout rates in higher education?"**
-  Hypothesis: **gamification has a positive impact on both academic performance and dropout rates**
-  Updated Gantt Chart and Project Proposal.
- Found more data on student attitudes in regards to gamification (surveys were mostly done in the form of box plots with the occasional pie chart).
- found ways to clean data: panda's for handling null/empty values, numpy for handling arrays of data and sklearn for researching patterns in the collected data.
