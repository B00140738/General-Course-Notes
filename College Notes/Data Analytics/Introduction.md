## **What is Data Analytics?**
- **Definition:** Techniques to analyze large datasets and extract actionable insights.
- **Goals:**
  - Discover trends and patterns.
  - Identify hidden relationships.
  - Transform knowledge into actionable results.
- **Examples:**
  - Correlations in disease groups.
  - Predicting high-spending customers.

---

## **Why Data Analytics?**
- **Data Explosion:** Rapid data accumulation across multiple sources (databases, text files, web).
- **Challenges:** Data storage is easier, but analysis is complex.
- **Solution:** Data analytics leverages processes and technologies to address challenges.

---

## **Application Areas of Data Mining**
- **E-commerce:** Recommendation systems (e.g., Amazon).
- **Banking:** Credit models for loan predictions.
- **Other Fields:**
  - Science: Astronomy, Bioinformatics
  - Business: Advertising, CRM, Fraud detection
  - Government: Anti-terrorism, Tax profiling

---

## **Data Mining Tasks**
- **Classification:** Predict values (e.g., win/loss outcomes).
- **Clustering:** Group similar entities (e.g., customer segmentation).
- **Association:** Identify relationships (e.g., "people who buy X also buy Y").
- **Visualization:** Present data through graphs/plots.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identify outliers.

---

## **Defining Data Analytics**
- **Definition:** A non-trivial process to identify valid, novel, useful, and understandable patterns in data (Fayyad et al).
- **Key Aspects:**
  - **Process:** Involves multiple steps.
  - **Novelty:** Insights should be new.
  - **Usefulness:** Should lead to actionable outcomes.
  - **Interdisciplinary:** Combines statistics, AI, etc.

## **Data Analytics Model**
### CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)
- Developed by Daimler-Benz, SPSS, and NCR.
- **Benefits:**
  - Ensures consistency.
  - Enables project replication.
  - Provides a structured approach.
- **Phases:**
  1. Business Understanding
  2. Data Understanding
  3. Data Preparation
  4. Modeling
  5. Evaluation
  6. Deployment

---

## **CRISP-DM Process**
### Phase 1: Business Understanding
- Define business and data mining objectives.
- Example:
  - **Business Objective:** Increase catalog sales.
  - **Mining Objective:** Predict customer purchases based on past behavior.

### Phase 2: Data Understanding
- Tasks:
  - Data collection.
  - Data description (e.g., types, attributes).
  - Data exploration (e.g., patterns, visualizations).
  - Data quality checks (e.g., missing values, biases).

### Phase 3: Data Preparation
- Most time-consuming phase (~80% of effort).
- Tasks:
  - Data cleaning, selection, and transformation.
  - Integration and formatting for modeling.

### Phase 4: Modeling
- Select modeling techniques (e.g., decision trees, regression).
- Build and assess models.
- Evaluate against success criteria (e.g., accuracy, reliability).

### Phase 5: Evaluation
- Approve the final model.
- Ensure alignment with business objectives.
- Identify overlooked factors or challenges.

### Phase 6: Deployment
- Plan for results utilization (e.g., predictions, business rules).
- Deployment tasks include scoring databases and monitoring.
