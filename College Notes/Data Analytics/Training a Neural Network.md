###  **The process of training a neural network**

Training a neural network involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**:
    
    - Initialize the weights and biases of the network, often with small random values.
    
2. **Forward Propagation**:
    
    - Input data is passed through the network.
    - **Each node computes a weighted sum of its inputs, adds the bias, and applies an activation function (e.g., sigmoid) to generate an output.**
    
3. **Loss Calculation**:
    
    - **Compare the network's predicted output with the actual output** (target value) using a loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error or Cross-Entropy Loss).
    
4. **Backpropagation**:
    
    - Calculate the gradients of the loss with respect to each weight and bias using the chain rule of calculus.
    - This involves propagating the error backward through the network.
    
5. **Weight and Bias Updates**:
    
    - Adjust the weights and biases using the gradients calculated during backpropagation.
    - Update rule: `new_weight = old_weight - learning_rate * gradient`.
    
6. **Repeat**:
    
    - **Perform multiple iterations (epochs) of forward propagation, loss calculation, backpropagation, and updates** until the loss converges or a specified number of epochs are completed.
